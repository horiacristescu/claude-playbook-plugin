<!-- PLAYBOOK TEMPLATE
  This file was installed by the playbook plugin. It contains the universal
  workflow instructions that every playbook-managed project needs.

  IF THIS FILE IS AT `.claude/templates/CLAUDE.md`:
    Merge the sections below into the project's root CLAUDE.md.
    Preserve all existing project-specific content (project description,
    custom rules, architecture notes). Add or update the sections from
    this template. If those sections already exist in CLAUDE.md, update
    them to match this version without duplicating content.

  IF THIS FILE IS AT `CLAUDE.md` (project root):
    Replace "Project Name" below with the actual project name.
    Add any project-specific instructions after the template sections.
-->

# Project Name

## Start Here

```bash
.claude/bin/tasks bootstrap          # loads mind map, skills, pending tasks
```

Then **ask the user** what they want to work on. Don't autonomously pick a task.

## Mind Map

Read `MIND_MAP.md` at project root before starting any work. It's the project's institutional memory — architecture, decisions, history, and reasoning. Consult it before each task, update it after completing one.

## Task Lifecycle

1. `.claude/bin/tasks new <type> <name>` — creates `.agent/tasks/NNN-name/task.md` from the base template
2. `.claude/bin/tasks work <N>` — activates the task, hooks start enforcing
3. Work through task.md gates: Design Phase (understand, structure, verify) → Work Plan (build/investigate gates) → Pre-review
4. Check each gate's checkbox as you complete it, appending your observations on the same line
5. `.claude/bin/tasks work done` — deactivates the task, sets status to done

The task.md **is** the execution trace. Never skip checkboxes. Never backfill. One gate at a time.

## CLI

```bash
.claude/bin/tasks work <number>              # activate task, hook starts tracking
.claude/bin/tasks work done                  # deactivate when finished
.claude/bin/tasks new <type> <name>          # create task — does NOT activate
.claude/bin/tasks list [--pending]           # task overview
.claude/bin/tasks status                     # current gate position
.claude/bin/tasks bootstrap                  # orientation: mind map + skills + pending
```

## Don't

- Create task directories manually — always `.claude/bin/tasks new`
- Edit `.agent/current_state` — use `.claude/bin/tasks work <N>` / `.claude/bin/tasks work done`
- Edit `## Status` in task.md directly — use `.claude/bin/tasks work done`
- Skip task.md checkboxes — they're your observable progress
- Start coding without an active task — blocked by hook until `.claude/bin/tasks work <N>`
